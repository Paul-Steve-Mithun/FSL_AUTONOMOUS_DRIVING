# FSL_AUTONOMOUS_DRIVING
**FSL_MODEL_EVALUATE**
-where the custom dataset class is defined and a sample view of the dataset is observed.
-The Prototypical Model is defined and the same is Evaluated for Accuracy, with a single and multiple episodes.
-Finally the checkpoints are saved.

**FSL_TRAIN**
-Where the model is trained with the given dataset for 10 episodes.
-Finally the Checkpoint is saved.

**FSL_TEST_IMAGE**
-Gives an idea how the bounding box algorithm works and how the FSL Model Classifies the given image.

**FSL_TEST_VIDEO**
-Threshold based filtering is implemented.
-Confidence and NMS Threshold is Adjusted.
-Output video is processed and Saved on the drive.
